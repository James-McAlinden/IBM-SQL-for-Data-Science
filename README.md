# IBM-SQL-for-Data-Science
In this course, I learnt the basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Some of the advanced concepts included using methods like views, transactions, stored procedures, and joins. During this course, I: 
•	Wrote key SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
•	Used filter functions like the WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses.
•	Used the CREATE, ALTER, DROP functions when working with tables. 
•	Utilised string patterns and ranges such as ORDER and GROUP result sets.
•	Build sub-queries and query data when working with multiple tables. 
•	Accessed databases by using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python.
•	Created a relational database and worked with multiple tables using DDL commands.
